# Carousel

## Instructions:

You will make at least one carousel allowing to scroll a number of free pictures to a
regular time interval.

Your code should work whether for 3 or 20 pictures. When the
slider comes to the last picture, he comes back to the start.

To go further: each image is accompanied by a small description text. Its buttons
are present on the slide to allow the user to scroll through the images himself.
